# VisionSite

Welcome to VisionSite! Using a code editor, work through the code prompts in the index.html file to determine your *path moving forward*, complete with inspirational quotes, music, personal goals, and statements of thankfulness. Along the way, you'll learn a little about coding and computer science. 

**VisionSite was designed by Pitt students Carter Keith, Domonique Swift, Janet Majekodunmi, and Makye Daniels.**     
    
    
## Get started or return to edit and host your site on GitHub! 

1. Go to the [Vision Site Template](https://github.com/CodELA-k12/visionsite).

2. Click the green "Code" button and then select "Download ZIP" to your local computer. 

3. Find this folder in your downloads. Move this folder to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

4. Download and/or open with a text editor like  

5. Use the text editor to open the index.html document from your project folder.  

6. Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text! 

7. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click  "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes." 

8. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" in the left-hand menu. Change the source setting from "none" to "main" "/root" and then Click "Save"

9. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL. (This process may take up to five minutes.)

10. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
